# LeetCode Easy Solutions (Java)

Welcome to my personal collection of solutions for "Easy" difficulty problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). All solutions in this repository are implemented in Java.

## üöÄ Purpose & Goals

This repository serves several key purposes for my learning journey:

* **Algorithmic Practice:** To consistently practice and solidify my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms (DSA).
* **Problem-Solving Skills:** To enhance my analytical and problem-solving capabilities by tackling a wide range of coding challenges.
* **Knowledge Consolidation:** To maintain a structured and organized record of all solved LeetCode problems for future review, reference, and quick access during interviews or other coding tasks.
* **Clean Code Principles:** To write clear, concise, and efficient Java code, focusing on readability and best practices for each solution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java
* **Development Environment:** Primarily developed and tested using IntelliJ IDEA.

## üéØ How to Use / Run Solutions

To run any of these solutions locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourLeetCodeRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourLeetCodeRepoName.git)
    cd YourLeetCodeRepoName
    ```
    (Replace `YourUsername` and `YourLeetCodeRepoName` with your actual GitHub username and repository name)

2.  **Open in an IDE:** Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code). The project is set up as a standard Java project.

3.  **Run the `main` method (if present):** Many LeetCode solutions are just class methods. To test them, you might need to create a simple `main` method in a test file (or within the solution file temporarily) to call the function with sample inputs.

## üôè Contributions
